# QRCode Inventory Manager

The QRCode Inventory Manager is a utility tool designed to generate QR codes for use in an inventory management system. This project was developed to complement an internal software solution I designed for efficient item tracking and management within a specific company.

## Features
- Generate QR codes with unique IDs for each item in the inventory.
- Associate QR codes with items in the backend/database.
- Save QR codes along with their IDs in a PDF format for printing and record-keeping.
- Customize QR codes by adding logos or other visual elements.
- Integrate QR codes into an inventory system to facilitate efficient item tracking and management.

## Getting Started
To get started with the QRCode Inventory Manager, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Modify the code to integrate with your backend/database for item association.
- Customize the QR code generation process according to your needs.
- Run the program and generate QR codes.

## Usage
- Run the program and provide the desired settings.
- QR codes will be generated with unique IDs and associated data.
- QR codes can be saved in a PDF format for printing or digital storage.
- Integrate the QR codes into your inventory system by scanning them or linking them to the relevant item records.

## Example
Imagine your company has developed a proprietary internal software to revolutionize inventory management. This software empowers employees to easily track, update, and manage items throughout the company's operations. To enhance this system, the QRCode Inventory Manager was crafted. By generating QR codes with distinct IDs and relevant information, your software can instantly associate scanned QR codes with specific items, streamlining workflows and increasing accuracy.
